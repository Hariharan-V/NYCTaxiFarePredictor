# NYCTaxiFarePredictor
CS 559 project
Written using python 2.7
To compile, run "python <filename.py>"

4 Files included: KNN.py (K nearest Neighbors), NN.py (Regression using Neural Networks), DNN.py (non linear regression using Deep neural networks, experiment basis, not actual solution), and MLE.py

KNN takes a while to compute, please be a little patient to see results. 

I pledge my honor that I've abided by the stevens honor system
Code for DNN inspired by https://medium.com/@rajatgupta310198/getting-started-with-neural-network-for-regression-and-tensorflow-58ad3bd75223, again, not my actual solution, just done for experimental purpose. 
Thank you.
